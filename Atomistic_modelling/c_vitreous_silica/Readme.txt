The tensile tests were carried out under NPT conditions initially, but later the same was done under NVT where sample showed brittle nature. 
The size and shape of the specimen was varied and an expected brittle response was observed under NPT ensemble for elongated sizes, as reported in previous studies (Yuan et al, 2012).

   In this work, molecular dynamics simulations have been used to study the brittle fracture behaviour of vitreous silica in mixed mode loading. An implementation of the BKS potential with the coulombic term was used along with Lennord-Jones modification to model initial cristobalite. Ewald summation was used to obtain long-range coulombic contribution to the total potential energy of the system. A recipe (Huff et al., Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids, 253, 133-142, year) was used to obtain the vitreous silica using a combination of different molecular dynamics runs which were done initially as NVT ensemble and at the end as NPT ensemble. Uniaxial tensile tests were carried out and the results were analyzed under different NPT and NVT conditions. The stress-strain response along with the elastic properties agreed very well with the existing studies which confirmed that vitreous silica had indeed been modeled. A center crack was further introduced in the specimen and subjected to mixed mode loading by moving the boundaries slowly. The crack growth response was then observed and studied.
