The tensile tests were carried out under NPT conditions initially, but later the same was done under NVT where sample showed brittle nature. 
The size and shape of the specimen was varied and brittle response was observed under NPT ensemble for elongated sizes, as reported in previous studies (Yuan et al, 2012).
